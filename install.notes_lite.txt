# In the following instructions a step starts with a #, a comment to you is a line surrounded by ( ). These should not be typed.

# 1. Install Git ( you may have done this already )
( Use installer from http://msysgit.github.io )
( in wizard add link to desktop )
( Note I pulled a git repository from on to the desktop named 2014_scAnalysis, that is not required, I will have attendies do that. They will just need git. )

# 2. RStudio
( Download RStudio at http://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio )

# 3. Download source library
( This step is for Mac and Linux, the SCDE library is not compatible with windows at this time. )
( Once library that is being installed will need the source to be downloaded, everything else can be pulled off of remote repos. )
# We will need to install one library from source. This works by first downloading a source tarball and having R install from source
( Go to http://pklab.med.harvard.edu/scde/index.html )
( Click on the green Version 1.1 link to download the file scde_1.1.tar.gz )
( Download http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/RcppArmadillo_0.4.400.0.tar.gz )
( Download http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/multicore/multicore_0.2.tar.gz )

# 3. R Libraries
# Installed from with in RStudio
# Several of these commands rely on preceding commands so the order of the commands should be kept
( First open RStudio )
( In the GUI there will be a window titled R Console )
( In the R Console past the following library install commands ( you must be connected to the internet ) )
install.packages( "knitr" )
( Select USA (CA1), do this as needed )
install.packages( "scatterplot3d" )
install.packages( "gplots" )
install.packages( "boot" )
install.packages( "caret" )
install.packages( "mclust" )
install.packages( "flexmix" )
install.packages( "Cairo" )
( The rest of this section is not compatible with a windows machine. One of the needed libraries has a dependency that will not work on windows but will on Mac or linux. )
source( "http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R" )
biocLite("edgeR")
( With the next commands, your path to the file may change depending on where it is located and what system you are using. )
install.packages( "/Users/username/RccpArmadillo_0.4.400.0.tar.gz", repos=NULL, type="source" )
install.packages( "/Users/username/multicore_0.2.tar.gz", repos=NULL, type="source" )
install.packages( "/Users/username/scde_1.1.tar.gz", repos=NULL, type="source" )

# 5. Check system
( Open RStudio, copy and past the following commands, in the R Console. If you get no errors then all librarys can load :-) )
library( boot )
library( caret )
library( gplots )
library( mclust )
library( scatterplot3d )
( The next library is currently not compatible with windows. )
library( scde )
